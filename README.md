Full Paper: [3200947.3201011](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3200947.3201011)

All code is written using Keras and Tensorflow.

You can find NILMTK-compatible versions of these networks on https://github.com/OdysseasKr/neural-disaggregator.

**Requires NILMTK to run. You can find it here:** https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk.

## The networks
In each folder you can find a README with instructions on how to run the experiments. For every network you will find 4 Python files:

- experiment.py: Code for running the experiment. Each experiment includes training and evaluating the network.
- gen.py: Downloads all necessary resources and generates a trainset and a testset.
- model.py: The network architecture.
- metrics.py: The metrics used to evaluate the network.

The experiments are available for the following appliances from the UKDALE dataset:
- Dishwasher
- Fridge
- Kettle
- Microwave
- Washing Machine
